# Supervised Machine Learning With Scikit-learn and Diabetes

Diabetes data set is one of the most known data available to ML enthusiasts and their learning purposes. The data is publically available on UCI Machine Learning Repostory: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes

I focused only on four classifiers: i.) k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), ii.) logistic regression, iii.) decision tree and iv.) random forest.
I share how I handled missing records differently.
Secondly, I will be fitting the model using Pipeline and SimpleImputer as the arguments of GridSearchCV. To achieve the best performance and generability, I tuned hyperparameters for every model.
Last but not least, I maintain that accuracy is not, and should not be, the only criteria when evaluating your modelâ€™s performance!
